I am teaching a course on geometric group theory in the winter semester of 2025/6. The course will take place on Thursdays at 14.00-16.00 in the Kleiner Hörsaal in Wegelerstraße 10. I will try to upload notes as the course progresses.

[Lecture 1](https://lawk-mineh.github.io//files/course/Lecture_1.pdf): Group presentations, actions, Cayley graphs, and quasi-isometries.

[Lecture 2](https://lawk-mineh.github.io//files/course/Lecture_2.pdf): Quasi-geodesics, the Milnor-Schwarz lemma, classical hyperbolic geometry.

[Lecture 3](https://lawk-mineh.github.io//files/course/Lecture_3.pdf): Some more classical hyperbolic geometry, hyperbolic metric spaces, the Morse Lemma.

[Lecture 4](https://lawk-mineh.github.io//files/course/Lecture_4.pdf): Quasi-isometric invariance of hyperbolicity, local quasigeodesics in hyperbolic spaces, quasiconvexity.

[Lecture 5](https://lawk-mineh.github.io//files/course/Lecture_5.pdf): The boundary of a hyperbolic metric space, isometries of hyperbolic metric spaces.

[Lecture 6](https://lawk-mineh.github.io//files/course/Lecture_6.pdf): Hyperbolic groups, centralisers of elements, and finite subgroups.

[Lecture 7](https://lawk-mineh.github.io//files/course/Lecture_7.pdf): Convergence groups: set-up and basic theory.
