I am teaching a course on geometric group theory in the winter semester of 2025/6. The course will take place on Thursdays at 14.00-16.00 in room 1.007 (MI). I will try to upload notes as the course progresses.

[Lecture 1](https://lawk-mineh.github.io//files/course/Lecture_1.pdf): Group presentations, actions, Cayley graphs, and quasi-isometries.

[Lecture 2](https://lawk-mineh.github.io//files/course/Lecture_2.pdf): Quasi-geodesics, the Milnor-Schwarz lemma, classical hyperbolic geometry.
