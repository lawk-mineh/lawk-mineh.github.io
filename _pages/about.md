I am a second year PhD student in mathematics at the University of Southampton, working under the supervision of Ashot Minasyan.
My field is geometric group theory, and my main research interest is nonpositive curvature in group theory.
Currently I am thinking about the relationship between profinite topology and quasiconvexity in relatively hyperbolic groups.

This year I am organising the postgraduate pure mathematics seminar at Southampton.
Information on talks can be found by clicking the "PGR Seminar" tab above.
