<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I am a fourth year PhD student in mathematics at the University of Southampton, working under the supervision of Ashot Minasyan.
My field is geometric group theory, with my main objects of study being groups that satisfy various nonpositive curvature conditions.
I am interested in trying to understand the relationship between algebraic and geometric properties of subgroups in nonpositively curved groups.</p>

<p>You can contact me at L [dot] Mineh [at] soton [dot] ac [dot] uk. <a href="https://lawk-mineh.github.io//files/CV.pdf">Here</a> is a copy of my CV.</p>

<p>In my spare time I tend to be climbing, walking long distances, or playing guitar.</p>
