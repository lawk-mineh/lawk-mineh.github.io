<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I am a third year PhD student in mathematics at the University of Southampton, working under the supervision of Ashot Minasyan.
My field is geometric group theory, with my main objects of study being groups that satisfy various nonpositive curvature conditions.
Currently, I am trying to understand how the profinite topology behaves in such groups.</p>

<p>You can contact me at L [dot] Mineh [at] soton [dot] ac [dot] uk.</p>

<p>In my spare time I tend to be climbing, walking long distances, or playing guitar (poorly).</p>
